    "# Introduction\n",
    "The selection sort can be implemented in two approaches by considering the largest elements or the smallest elements. Here we are considering the maximum elements sorting procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The selection sort improves on the bubble sort by making only one exchange for every pass through the list.\n",
    "- A selection sort looks for the largest value as it makes a pass and, after completing the pass, places in the proper location.\n",
    "- After the first pass, the largest item is in the correct place. After the second pass, the next largest is in place.\n",
    "- This process continues and requires $(n-1)$ passes to sort $n$ items, since the final item must be in place after the $(n-1)st$ pass"

    "- Another $O(N^2)$ running time sorting algorithm\n",
    "- Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and it has perfomance advantages over more complicated algorithms\n",
    "- Particularly useful where auxiliary memory is limited.\n",
    "- The algorithm divides the input list into two parts:\n",
    "    - The subarray of items already sorted\n",
    "    - and the subarray of tiems remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the array\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Quite counter-intutive: selection sort and insertion sort are both typically faster for small arrays [arrays with 10-20 items]\n",
    "- Makes less writes than insertion sort -> this can be important if writes are significantly more expensive than reads.\n",
    "- For example with EEPROM or flash memory where every write lessens the lifespan of the memory"
